To access the microservice, go to `http://methodapp.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/`
From there, you can add `fizzbuzz` to the end of the URL in order to run a default fizzbuzz program, or you can enter another URL with the format
```
/fizzbuzz/cap={cap}&fizz={fizz}&buzz={buzz}&bazz={bazz}
```
to run a program that replaces the corresponding words with words of your choosing
