# How to run:
Visit:
		https://t8nhzdycmd.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/test/calc/

Then: at the end of the url feel free to input any two integers and +,-,* to add, subtract, or multiply them.
For example:
		https://t8nhzdycmd.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/test/calc/4/2/+

Will take the two integers 4 and 2 and add them together to get 6.
